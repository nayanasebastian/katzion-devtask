# katzion-devtask

Prerequisite:
To test the API, two additional objects have been added.
1. Stub - sample executable apex code is available under /scripts folder, to create two Stub responses for the test the two API calls.
2. Exception Log - for API failure instance, a simple logging has been added using this object. This may be used in monitoring tools or for email alerts for a real time application.

Connected app and auth provider/nc are added to work with a Webservice class and Stubs to act as an API at runtime.
